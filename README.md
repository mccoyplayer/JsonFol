### About
json-coder is an open source tool built for generating json parsing code for
your Android project. Submit your JSON response and get the parsing code
generated in JAVA for you.<br>
Currently, it is in beta and may not work for highly depth JSON responses. But,
I am working on it. <br>
You may expect parsing code for both JAVA and Kotlin in the future soon.
