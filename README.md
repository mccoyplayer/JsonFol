JSON Parsing Code Generator for Android
Visit https://nerdyninja.github.io/json-coder

### About
json-coder is an open source tool built for generating json parsing code for
your Android project. Submit your JSON response and get the parsing code
generated in JAVA for you.
Currently, it is in beta and may not work for highly depth JSON responses. But,
I am working on it. 
You may expect parsing code for both JAVA and Kotlin in the future soon.
